# Introduction

  As nowadays, more and more people are concerned about health, organic food 
  becomes a more popular choice. In general, there is no universal way to define 
  organic food, but since the main goal of organic agriculture is to optimize the
  biodiversity  as well as the ecological balance, the usage of synthetic chemicals
  are restricted (food unfolded 2019). In this study, the berry data collected by 
  the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) database selector and stored 
  online was explored and analyzed to compare the types and quantities of chemicals
  applied for planting strawberries during different years and in different states. 
  
  
# Methodology
### Data Cleaning & Variable Selection

  The berry dataset contains information about three kinds of berries, which are
  blueberries, raspberries and strawberries. In this study, only the data points 
  related to strawberries are considered. Firstly, some of the variables only have
  one unique value for all the observations, which cannot provide any useful 
  information for the purpose of comparison and can be removed. It turns out that
  12 out of the 21 variables only have one unique value, such as "Program", "Week 
  Ending", "Geo Level" and etc. After the first step, the dataset now had 8 variables
  and 3220 observations in total. Next, since the variable "Data Item" contains
  lots of different information in one single cell, it needs to be reorganized 
  and renamed. After this step, the variable "Data Item" were separated into 4 
  new variables, which are "berry" (types of berry), "market" (marketing condition),
  "harvest" (harvest condition) and "units" (units of values collected). Similarly,
  the variable "Domain" was separated into "Domain_1" and "Domain_2", and the variable
  "Domain Category" was separated into "DC_1_left", "DC_1_right", "DC_2_left" and 
  "DC_2_right" first. After carefully checking the unique combinations, it was 
  found that variables "Domain_1" and "DC_1_left" produced exactly the same values.
  Similarly, it was found that variables "Domain_2" and "DC_2_left" produced exactly
  the same values. Therefore, only "Domain_1" and "Domain_2" were kept, combined 
  and renamed to be "chemical", which states the type of chemicals being used.
  
  
  After the above steps, the data still contained much information than needed 
  and required deeper cleaning. The final strawberry data set was selected to 
  include 8 variables, which were Year, State, market, harvest, materials, chemical,
  Values and units, that all could provide useful information for analysis. All 
  the NA values and D values that are used to withhold to avoid data disclosure 
  were removed from the variable "Value". Then, this tidy data was used to subset
  a smaller data set of interest, which only looked at observations where chemicals
  were applied. This was done by only selecting rows with harvest values equal to 
  "APPLICATIONS" and unit values equal to "LB / ACRE / APPLICATION". Now, the smaller 
  data set "unfood" only contained information about the pounds of chemicals used
  per acre in some states and years, which were all prepared to be analyzed and 
  compared.


  All the R code and data used were attached in the Appendix and also in the 
  GitHub repository (https://github.com/Ruxinliu97/Berry).  


# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

  Based on the dataset, it is found that only California, Florida and Washington 
  used chemicals when planting strawberries during the year 2016, 2018 and 2019.
  In order to see any differences, histograms are plotted by using the ggplot2 
  package. From Fig.1, it is shown that the number of strawberry farms which 
  applied chemicals varied a lot from states to states. For Washington, there
  were just 3 cases of chemical usage detected in the year 2016 only. The figure
  also conveyed that although none of the farms used chemicals in California and 
  Florida for the year 2017, there was continuous and relatively large use of 
  chemicals in other years. Among the 3 states, the farms that used chemicals when
  planting strawberries were mostly from California.

unfood %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = Year)) +
  geom_bar(aes(fill = State)) +
  ggtitle("Number Of Strawberry Farms That Used Chemicals") +
  labs(caption = "Fig.1")
```

  From Fig.2, it is shown that among the 225 observations, the kinds of chemicals 
  being applied were also different. It is clear that for all 3 years, herbicides 
  and insecticides were used by most farms.

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
unfood %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = Year)) +
  geom_bar(aes(fill = chemical)) +
  ggtitle("The Annual Usage Frequency Of Each Chemicals") +
  labs(caption = "Fig.2")
```


  In order to make a better comparison, the 4 kinds of synthetic chemicals, which
  are fungicide, herbicide, insecticide and other, were also explored and summarized
  separately. Based on the results of Table 1 below, in 2016 one farm in Florida 
  had the lowest pounds of fungicide usage per acre per application, which was 0.01,
  while one farm in California had the highest usage application, which was 3.712. 
  In 2018, one farm in California had the lowest pounds of fungicide usage per acre
  per application, which was 0.022, while another farm in California had the highest 
  usage, which was 4.864. In 2019, one farm in California had the lowest pounds 
  of fungicide usage per acre per application, which was 0.023, while one farm
  in Florida had the highest usage, which was 3.997. The sum of the fungicide pounds
  may not be suitable for comparisons since each State had different number of 
  strawberry farms. However, from the mean value, it is clear that in recent years,
  Florida on average had a noticeably higher average pounds of fungicide usage 
  per acre per application. 
  


```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(kableExtra)
fungicide <- unfood %>% 
  filter(chemical == "FUNGICIDE") %>% 
  group_by(Year, State) %>% 
  summarise(min = min(as.numeric(Value)), 
            max = max(as.numeric(Value)),
            mean = mean(as.numeric(Value)), 
            sum = sum(as.numeric(Value)))
knitr::kable(fungicide, caption = "Fungicide Application ", digits = 3) %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_styling(latex_options = "hold_position")
```
  
  
  Based on the results of Table 2 below, in 2016 one farm in California had the lowest 
  pounds of herbicide usage per acre per application, which was 0.091, while 
  also one farm in California had the highest usage, which was 1.382. However, in
  2018 and 2019, strawberry farms from Washington and Florida did not have any 
  herbicide application, which suggests that only strawberry farms from California 
  used herbicides in recent years. Also, both the highest mean usage and the 
  highest total usage occurred in 2016. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
herbicide <- unfood %>% 
  filter(chemical == "HERBICIDE") %>% 
  group_by(Year, State) %>% 
  summarise(min = min(as.numeric(Value)), 
            max = max(as.numeric(Value)),
            mean = mean(as.numeric(Value)), 
            sum = sum(as.numeric(Value)))
knitr::kable(herbicide, caption = "Herbicide Application ", digits = 3) %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_styling(latex_options = "hold_position")
```


  Based on the results of Table 3 below, in 2016 one farm in California had the lowest pounds of insecticide usage per acre per application, which was 0.019, while  also one farm in California had the highest usage, which was 5.86. In 2018, only farms in California had insecticide applications with a maximum pounds per acre of 6.34. In 2019, one farm in California had the lowest pounds of insecticide usage per acre per application, which was 0.019, while  again one farm in California had the highest usage, which was 5.151. Overall, regardless of which year, California always had the highest mean usage of insecticide.

  
```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
insecticide <- unfood %>% 
  filter(chemical == "INSECTICIDE") %>% 
  group_by(Year, State) %>% 
  summarise(min = min(as.numeric(Value)), 
            max = max(as.numeric(Value)),
            mean = mean(as.numeric(Value)), 
            sum = sum(as.numeric(Value)))
knitr::kable(insecticide, caption = "Insecticide Application ", digits = 3) %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_styling(latex_options = "hold_position")
```


  Lastly, from Table 4 below, it is shown that only strawberry farms from California
  used other kinds of chemicals and the mean usage in pounds per acre per application
  were much larger than the previous three kinds of chemical. Since the kinds of 
  chemicals that were defined as the other category were not clear, it is not 
  reasonable to consider these values into the comparison other than just a
  reference. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
other <- unfood %>% 
  filter(chemical == "OTHER") %>% 
  group_by(Year, State) %>% 
  summarise(min = min(as.numeric(Value)), 
            max = max(as.numeric(Value)),
            mean = mean(as.numeric(Value)), 
            sum = sum(as.numeric(Value)))
knitr::kable(other, caption = "Other Application ", digits = 3) %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_styling(latex_options = "hold_position")
```



# Conclusion

  In conclusion, based on the exploratory data analysis of the strawberry data,
  it is shown that only Florida, California and Washington had chemical applications
  in the farms, and the pounds of usage per acre per application differed by the 
  type of chemicals and also the years. And among the 225 observations where chemical 
  was applied, most sites were from California and only a few sites were from Washington.
  
  For all fungicides, herbicides and insecticides, the maximum usage per pound per
  acre per application always happened in California. Although in some years, the
  minimum usage also occurred in California, the pattern still suggests that there 
  might be some issues with the strawberry planting industry in California.
