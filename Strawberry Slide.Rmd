## Berry Data

- Collected by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)
  Available from: https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/ 
  
- 13238 rows and 21 columns

- Contained information about 3 kinds of berries: blueberries, raspberries & strawberries

- Year ranged from 2015 - 2019

- Goal: Compared the usage of synthetic chemicals applied for planting strawberries




## Data Cleaning & Variable Selection

- Removed 12 variables that only had one unique value, e.g "Program", "Week Ending",
"Geo Level" and etc

- Separated "Data Item" into "berry" (types of berry), "market" (marketing condition), 
"harvest" (harvest condition) and "units" (units of values collected)

- Reorganized and compared "Domain" and "Domain Category" into "materials" and "chemicals

- 8 variables left after data cleaning: Year, State, market, harvest, materials, 
chemical, Values and units

- Removed all NA values and D values 

- Created sub-dataset that showed the pounds of chemicals usage per acre per 
application for strawberries
 
  

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Difference among states
- Continuous and relatively large use of chemicals California and Florida

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
unfood_table %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = Year)) +
  geom_bar(aes(fill = State)) +
  ggtitle("Number Of Strawberry Farms That Used Chemicals")
```

## Difference among chemical types
- Herbicides and insecticides were used the most 

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
unfood_table %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = Year)) +
  geom_bar(aes(fill = chemical)) +
  ggtitle("The Annual Usage Frequency Of Each Chemicals")
```

## Fungicide

- Florida on average had a higher average pounds of fungicide usage per acre per
application.

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
fungicide <- unfood_table %>% 
  filter(chemical == "FUNGICIDE") %>% 
  group_by(Year, State) %>% 
  summarise(min = min(as.numeric(Value)), 
            max = max(as.numeric(Value)),
            mean = mean(as.numeric(Value)), 
            sum = sum(as.numeric(Value)))
knitr::kable(fungicide, digits = 3) %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_styling(latex_options = "hold_position")
```

## Herbicide
- California used herbicides continuously with relatively high level.

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
herbicide <- unfood_table %>% 
  filter(chemical == "HERBICIDE") %>% 
  group_by(Year, State) %>% 
  summarise(min = min(as.numeric(Value)), 
            max = max(as.numeric(Value)),
            mean = mean(as.numeric(Value)), 
            sum = sum(as.numeric(Value)))
knitr::kable(herbicide, caption = "Herbicide Application ", digits = 3) %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_styling(latex_options = "hold_position")
```

## Insecticide

- California always had the highest mean usage of insecticide compared to other
states. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
insecticide <- unfood_table %>% 
  filter(chemical == "INSECTICIDE") %>% 
  group_by(Year, State) %>% 
  summarise(min = min(as.numeric(Value)), 
            max = max(as.numeric(Value)),
            mean = mean(as.numeric(Value)), 
            sum = sum(as.numeric(Value)))
knitr::kable(insecticide, caption = "Insecticide Application ", digits = 3) %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_styling(latex_options = "hold_position")
```


## Conclusion 

- The pounds of usage per acre per chemical application differed by the type of
chemicals and also the years.

- For fungicides, herbicides and insecticides, the maximum usage per pound per 
acre per application all happened in California. 

- Suggests that there might be issues with the strawberry industry in California.

- Large amount of harmful pesticide usage -- already an existing and noticed problem 
in California

- Maybe consider about organic strawberries?
